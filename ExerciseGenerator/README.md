// Generate a single exercise
var config = new ExerciseConfiguration
{
    Level = SkillLevel.Beginner,
    Topic = TopicArea.CSharpFundamentals,
    Type = ExerciseType.Implementation,
    Context = "Personal finance tracker"
};

var exercise = generator.GenerateExercise(config);

// Export to files
generator.ExportExercise(exercise, "./my-exercises/");
```

## 📖 Exercise Types

### 🔨 Implementation Exercises
Build functionality from scratch using specified requirements and patterns.

**Example**: "Create a personal information calculator that handles different data types and performs conversions."

### 🔄 Refactoring Exercises
Transform poorly written code into clean, maintainable solutions.

**Example**: "Refactor a payment processing system from switch statements to Strategy Pattern."

### 🐛 Debug & Fix Exercises
Identify and correct issues in provided code while maintaining functionality.

**Example**: "Fix data type and conversion bugs in a statistics calculator."

### ➕ Extension Exercises
Add new features to existing code while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Example**: "Extend a basic calculator with advanced mathematical operations."

### 🏗️ Design Exercises
Create system architecture and design patterns for complex scenarios.

**Example**: "Design a notification system using Observer Pattern for multiple delivery channels."

### ⚡ Performance Exercises
Optimize slow or inefficient code for better performance.

**Example**: "Optimize a data processing pipeline using async/await and concurrent collections."

### 🧪 Testing Exercises
Write comprehensive unit tests and practice Test-Driven Development.

**Example**: "Implement a shopping cart using TDD with complete test coverage."
