# Fix Data Type and Conversion Bugs

**Skill Level:** Beginner
**Topic Area:** CSharpFundamentals
**Exercise Type:** DebugFix
**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

## Description
Debug and fix a program that has several common data type and conversion errors.

This exercise will help you practice:
- Identifying type conversion issues
- Understanding integer vs floating-point division
- Recognizing overflow and underflow problems
- Debugging compilation and runtime errors

## Learning Objectives
- Identify and fix type conversion errors
- Understand the difference between integer and floating-point division
- Recognize and handle numeric overflow issues
- Debug common compilation errors related to data types

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of C# data types
- Basic knowledge of type conversions
- Familiarity with arithmetic operations

## Problem Statement
The following program is supposed to calculate statistics for a small dataset, but it contains several bugs related to data types and conversions.

Your task is to:
1. Identify all the bugs in the code
2. Fix them while maintaining the intended functionality
3. Ensure the program produces accurate results

The program should calculate the average, find the maximum value, and determine the percentage of values above the average.

## Technical Requirements
- Fix all compilation errors
- Ensure accurate floating-point calculations
- Handle potential division by zero
- Use appropriate data types for all calculations

## Success Criteria
- Program compiles without errors
- Average calculation is accurate to 2 decimal places
- Maximum value is correctly identified
- Percentage calculation is accurate
- No runtime exceptions occur with valid input

## Common Pitfalls & Tips
- Don't worry about perfect code - focus on getting it working first
- Use descriptive variable names to make your code readable
- Test your code frequently with small changes
